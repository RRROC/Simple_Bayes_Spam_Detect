## A very simple Bayes Spam Email Classifier

Basically it calculates the word frequency in both positive data and negative data to achieve classification. 

1. Add more data in the datasets. (Please put the ham and spam email separately)
2. Run the classifier.py
3. It will print 1 if it is a spam mail, otherwise it will print 0.
